# 👋 Hey, I’m Sudhanshu !!

Data Scientist | ML Engineer | AI Researcher

I’m a **Data Science Master’s student at the UMich, Ann Arbor**, deeply interested in working on **fine-tuning LLMs, search & retrieval systems, and machine learning**

## 🌱 What I’m Into Lately -  
- My role as an RA last summer introduced me to **genomics and bioinformatics**, where I learned how to apply **clustering, differential gene expression analysis, and integration techniques** to extract insights from biological data.  

- Through a recent **IR project**, I explored **retrieval systems** by integrating **learning-to-rank models with LLMs and RAG pipelines** to improve **context-aware responses**.  

- In **LLMs**, I worked on a **hybrid attention framework** integrating **GLA, Mamba blocks, and LoRA** to improve **efficiency and scalability**. This helped me understand **model optimization, inference speed, and balancing performance with resource constraints**.  

- Working on deep learning optimization, I’ve learned how to make **ML systems faster, leaner, and more efficient**, balancing **performance with scalability**.  

- Currently diving deeper into **fine-tuning techniques, RAG strategies, and multi-modal learning** to push model capabilities even further.  

- Experimenting with **different model architectures and attention mechanisms**, figuring out what works best for improving efficiency and accuracy.  


## 🎖️ A Few Things I’m Proud Of  
**Mitacs Globalink Graduate Fellowship** – Awarded for my **research internship in Canada**, recognizing my work in **ML and AI applications**. 
**AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** – Because **ML models need scalable cloud setups**.  
**BCG Data Science & Advanced Analytics Program** – Hands-on experience with **business-driven ML solutions**.
